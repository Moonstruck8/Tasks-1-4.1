Everybody's talking 'bout how everything is falling apart
Let them worry, I'm just waiting, waiting for the party to start

Come a long way ___?
We can grab the keys
We were used to be
In the rearview mirror
Leave it all behind
See what we can find
Let's go

World's gone crazy
I think there's, I think there's, I think there's
Only one thing to do
Go crazy
I think that, I think that, I think that
We should go crazy too
Crazy
We should go crazy too
We should go, we should go, we should go
Likely so crazy, likely so crazy
Having a change of view
