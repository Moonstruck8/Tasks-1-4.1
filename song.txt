Everybody's talking 'bout how everything is falling apart
Let them worry, I'm just waiting, waiting for the party to start

Come a long way ___?
We can grab the keys
We were used to be
In the rearview mirror
Leave it all behind
See what we can find
Let's go

World's gone crazy
I think there's, I think there's, I think there's
Only one thing to do
Go crazy
I think that, I think that, I think that
We should go crazy too
Crazy
We should go crazy too
We should go, we should go, we should go
Likely so crazy, likely so crazy
Having a change of view

Everybody's talking 'bout how everything is coming undone
I think that means is time is time for fun and time for having some fun

Put your troubles down
Let some pressure 'round
You can scream and shout
If you wanna
Cause we're going wild
Doing it in style
What else you wish for

World's gone crazy
I think there's, I think there's, I think there's
Only one thing to do
Go crazy
I think that, I think that, I think that
We should go crazy too
Crazy
We should go crazy too
We should go, we should go, we should go
Likely so crazy, likely so crazy
Having a change of view

Maybe it's all falling, falling apart
Maybe we just need the party to start, yeah
___? use it, use it
Some just do it, do it
Let the music take us over

World's gone crazy (World's gone crazy)
World's gone crazy
Let's get crazy (World's gone crazy)
Let's get crazy
Let's get crazy (World's gone crazy)
Crazy
Likely so crazy, likely so crazy
Having a change of view

bring it on
